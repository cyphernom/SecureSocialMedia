# Secure Social Media

This is a security focused implementation of a DHT driven decentralised social media network. 

Each person running the app runs the DHT. 

The idea is data should be secure, as in only shareable to those who you chose (this is via a twostep encryption process - public key encryption is used to encrypt a common key)

And the data should be ephemeral- as in data should not be stored on social media forever haunting the individual that posted it. 

the nature of this, the fact its store in a memory only encrypted dht, means it is very unlikely for data to last very long in the system

there are no known instances of this running yet.
